Baseline
    - general implementation of DQN
    - plot results to compare



3 experiments
1. Massive parallel RL (if it doesnt work -> order of poll length) - Hannah


2. Hyperparameter tuning with evolutionary algorithms - Akshi


3. Something about the buffer - Sanne
    - how to sample
    - what to include
    - lifespan
    - threshold
    - probability


4. if space+time combine all of them together
