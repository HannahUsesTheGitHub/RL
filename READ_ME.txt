This repository is part of a graded assignment for the course "Introduction to Reinforcement Learning".

Included should be:

- A "weights" folder with 3 models for each approach (parallel DQN, Baseline, PER usage, EA)
- A "code" folder with one file (py or ipynb) per approach and additionally the provided test_scipt.py
- A "plots" folder with bar graphs created by the test_script for all models that are in the weights folder and additionally one graph for the training of the parallel DQN
- A 'results_excel' folder with all excel sheets generated by test_script.py for all the models in the weights folder
- This READ_ME file.

All of the code was written for python 10. Make sure to have all dependencies and modules installed correctly when running the files.
Only the Main branch of this repository includes all relevant files.
